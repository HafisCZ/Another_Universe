Hello, I am MAR21, and I am programming in Java, C/C++, Python 2.7 ...
And I want to present you my own 2D game IEntity engine. It is really cool and easy to use.
To create your own entity with this engine you need know these arguments:

BASICS:

1) Where will be entity displayed when game starts. (X cord and Y cord)
2) What will be the width and height of the entity. (This can be replaced 
	with getImageWidth() and getImageHeight() of the entity texture)
3) You need to know your 'bounds' of game, which can be the Window height and width.
4) You need to have your texture (only one need), but you want to have 3 different
	textures for different moves, this can be enabled with calling the setMoveTextures()
	function which takes 3 arguments, the left moving texture, stay texture and right moving texture.
5) You need to know how much will gravity be 'strong' in float.
6) You need to know the walking and the flying speed.
7) You need to know how much additional modifiers you need. You can do it after creating new
	instance of the IEntity with the flushControlls() function with one argument - the modifier allocation.
	There are different types of keyboard additional modifiers:
		1) addController(KEY, FUNCTION, POSITION, IEntity.KEYBOARD.STABLE);
		2) addController(KEY, FUNCTION, POSITION, IEntity.KEYBOARD.INSTANT);
	Some types of mouse modifiers:
		1) addController(MOUSE, FUNCTION, POSITION, IEntity.KEYBOARD.MOUSE);
	And of course now test-only binding modifiers which allows you to bind function to IEntity actions.
8) Of course there is ability to turn on IEntity to be controlled by computer.

So the initialization function can be:

IEntity player = new IEntity(0, 0, 32, 64, 640, 480, tex_player, 0.5F, 0.5F, 0.8F, 4, true);

We creating new instance of IEntity with name player with these arguments:
1) Entity spawn at X cord 0.
2) Entity spawn at Y cord 0.
3) Entity width is 32.
4) Entity height is 64.
5) Maximum reachable X cord is 640.
6) Maximum reachable Y cord is 480.
7) Entity texture is 'tex_entity'.
8) Entity gravity is 0.5F.
9) Entity speed is 0.5F.
10) Entity flying speed is 0.8F.
11) Allocate 4 slots for modifiers.
12) Controlled by controller not computer.

And we will set up this modifier for it:

player.addController(Keyboard.KEY_UP, IEntity.CONTROL.UPFLY, 0, IEntity.KEYBOARD.STABLE);

So we adding to slot 0 (Third argument) new controller with arguments:

1) When we press the Keyboard.KEY_UP key the controller will call function with second argument.
2) This argument is defining what action the key will do. So it can be: IEntity.CONTROL.DOWNFLY or .RIGHTWALK
	or other different actions.
3) We adding the controller to the null slot of the IEntity instance player.
4) We want to loop the function as long as we pressing the key.
	There are 2 types: IEntity.KEYBOARD.STABLE or .INSTANT. The Instant will only run the function one time,
	instead of Stable, which will loop the function as we holding the key.

And finally we need to update and draw the IEntity instance player. So we need to place this into the game loop:

player.update(delta);

The delta argument is the 'Delta'.

OPTIONAL:

You also turn on/off gravity on specified IEntity instances with this function:

instance.setGravity(true/false);

And also this function takes gravity 'strong' as an float argument:

instance.setGravity(0.5F);

Or obtain the gravity 'strong':

instance.getGravity();

Or obtain boolean of gravity enabled or disabled:

instance.isGravity();

You can set the X,Y cord and the width,height with these functions:

instance.setX(x);
instance.setY(y);
instance.setWidth(w);
instance.setHeight(h);

And obtain these values:

instance.getX();
instance.getY();
instance.getWidth();
instance.getHeight();

You can turn on/off the bordering with this:

instance.setBordered(true/false);

Or obtain the border values with:

instance.getBorder();

And add the borders:

instance.setBorder(x,y,max_x,max_y);

Of course is possible to set all textures:

instance.setTexture(WhenLookingForward);
instance.setRightTexture(WhenGoingRight);
instance.setLeftTexture(WhenGoingLeft);

And obtain the textures:

instance.getTexture();
instance.getRightTexture();
instance.getLeftTexture();

You can edit or obtain the Fly and Walk speed:

instance.setSpeed(s);
instance.getSpeed();
instance.setFlySpeed(s);
instance.getFlySpeed();

And you can edit the bottom border with:

instance.setMinimalY(y);
instance.getMinimalY();

You can too edit the frame Width and Height:

instance.setFrameHeight(h);
instance.getFrameHeight();
instance.setFrameWidht(w);
instance.getFrameWidht();

If you have computer controlled IEntity instance you can pause it:

instance.pauseEntity(true/false);
instance.isPaused();

And turn on and off the computer controller:

instance.setPlayable(true/false);
instance.isPlayable();

TEST-ONLY:

There is private setComputerController() but it dont do anything 'cause of broken code !
